<h1>Intalling KDH on Debian</h1>
<p>To make KDH work on Debian, it is possible that the hardware random number generator needs to be confgured for TLS to work</p>

<h2>Setting up the hardware random number generator</h2>
<p>
If the KDH software freezes immediately when it is run, then it is possibly a problem with the entropy collection system used by Debian. That might be fixed by doing the following from the command line:
</p>
<pre>
apt-get install haveged
update-rc.d haveged defaults
</pre>
